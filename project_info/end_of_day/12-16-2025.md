# End of Day Summary: 2025-12-16

## 1. Summary of Progress

Today's session involved a mix of project analysis, critical incident recovery, and feature development.

*   **Project Analysis & Onboarding:**
    *   Performed a comprehensive analysis of the entire codebase to build a working understanding of the project's architecture and features.
    *   Authored key documentation to establish a baseline for future development, including `README.md`, `summary.md`, and the `GEMINI.md` instructional context file.

*   **Development Planning:**
    *   Created and iteratively updated a detailed development plan in `project_info/todo-0.3.0.md`.
    *   This plan was used to track new issues, regressions, and mark completed tasks throughout the session.

*   **Core Bug Fixes & Enhancements:**
    *   **Background Tasks:** Refined the command parser in `shell.py` to correctly distinguish between background operators (`&`) and command chains (`&&`), and improved the `bg tasks` status report to be more descriptive (`COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, `TERMINATED`).
    *   **Non-Interactive Mode:** Implemented an initial fix for compatibility with external tools like Cockpit by adding `-c` flag handling. This task is now considered unresolved pending further validation.
    *   **Installer Robustness:** Hardened the `install.sh` script to prevent execution as root and to more reliably detect the user running the installation.

*   **Critical Incident Resolution:**
    *   Diagnosed and resolved a critical issue where the `main` branch was corrupted and local source files were missing.
    *   Successfully executed a user-directed plan to overwrite the `main` branch with the `rust-integration` branch.
    *   Authored a detailed incident report: `project_info/branch_corruption_incident_report.md`.

- aa772ec Restructure project layout and update documentation (Terabase-Studios, 33 minutes ago)

## 3. Blockers & Challenges

*   **Git Authentication & Identity:** The primary blocker was the repeated failure of `git commit` operations due to an incomplete Git `user.name` and `user.email` configuration in the execution environment. This required multiple attempts and direct user intervention to resolve.
*   **Workspace Integrity:** The session began with a severely corrupted workspace (missing source files), which required a significant recovery effort before development work could begin.

## 4. Next Steps

Based on the updated `todo-0.3.0.md`, the next priorities are:

1.  **Implement User Configuration Management**: Create a `config.toml` file to allow users to customize shell features.
2.  **Implement Autocomplete for Compound Commands**: Enhance the autocompletion engine to support `&&`, `||`, and `|`.
3.  **Implement Proper Sudo Highlighting**: Improve the syntax highlighter to correctly style commands used with `sudo`.
4.  **Enhance `install.sh` with PATH Prompt**: Add an interactive prompt to the Unix installer for PATH configuration.
